## Virtual Data Center Tours (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Through my summer internship with the NCSA, I had the amazing opportunity to go on a three-day field trip where we toured various HPC facilities. This project showcases some pictures I took at the Argonne National Lab, Purdue University, and Indiana University. I wanted to create a "digital scrapbook" with some educational and technical information about these computing systems and their respective facilities.
