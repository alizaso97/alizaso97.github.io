## Virtual Data Center Tours

Through the STEP-2 program, I had the amazing opportunity to go on a three-day field trip where we toured various HPC facilities. This project showcases some pictures I took at the Argonne National Lab, Purdue University, and Indiana University. I wanted to create a "digital scrapbook" which includes some historical and technical information about these computing systems and their respective facilities.

## Terminal User Interfaces with Python Curses

This is a collection of small personal projects I worked on to get more familiar with TUIs and Python. At this point in my education, all my training in Python has been sporadic and self-guided. I figured this project would give me more guidance, and I got to play with some UI/UX stuff which I don't normally do.
