# About
- **Educational Goals:** To become more familiar with industry tools, defensive security practices, digital forensics, and securing cloud-based environments
- **Professional Goals:** After I graduate, I would like to work as a security operations analyst in high-performance/research computing. I'm also interested in security for industrial control systems and Linux systems
- **Fun Goals:** Travel to the Basque country in Spain, see the Hobbit Holes in New Zealand, and I've played the guitar for 22 years so... buy as many guitars as humanly possible!
